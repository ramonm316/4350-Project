         <h2>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are the students from CMPS 4350 Advanced Software Engineering. We are in the process of creating an android application for everyone to be able to download. This application was made to help students decide which homework they should work on. Many students do not know which homework they should start first. This Homework Randomizer will allow the students to be able to input their homeworks into a list, and the randomizer button will randomly pick a homework that the student has input. There will be special features in this app that will make it fun and easy to use. It's an app created by students for students. So please, come try out our App! It's free to download from the home page or the versions page. All you need to do is click on the images. We all hope you enjoy our app. Have a great semester!</h2>
